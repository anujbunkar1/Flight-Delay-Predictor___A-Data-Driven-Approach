### Flight Delay Predictor: A Data Driven Approach

This project is a comprehensive analysis of flight delays in the airline industry. The goal of the project is to predict whether a flight will be delayed or not, based on various input features such as scheduled departure time, carrier information, destination and origin information, distance between airports, and weather conditions.

The airline industry is a vital part of the global economy, with millions of passengers traveling daily. However, flight delays can have a significant impact on passengers, airlines, and the economy as a whole. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, in 2019, there were over 4 million delayed flights in the United States alone, resulting in billions of dollars in lost productivity and revenue.

To tackle this problem, this project uses machine learning techniques such as kNN and logistic regression to predict flight delays. The dataset used in this analysis is real-world data collected from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The data is preprocessed, cleaned, and normalized before being fed into the models.

Through this analysis, we found that the kNN model with k=15 performed the best, with an AUC score of 67%. Additionally, we used a threshold of 0.5 to make predictions, but this can be adjusted based on the specific needs of the airline.

The results of this analysis can be used by airlines to improve their operations and better manage flight delays. By predicting potential delays, airlines can take proactive measures to reduce their impact and improve the overall passenger experience. 

It is interesting to note that the top three factors that have the most impact on flight delays are bad weather, distance between airports, and the scheduled departure time. This information can be used by airlines to improve their operations and reduce flight delays. Furthermore, this model is deployed as a web application, so that passengers can check the likelihood of a flight being delayed before they plan their trip.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the power of machine learning in solving real-world problems and highlights the importance of accurate flight delay prediction in the airline industry. It also shows that even with the increasing complexity of the airline industry, accurate predictions can be made by analyzing vast amounts of data and applying appropriate machine learning techniques.
